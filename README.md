# 🌍 PlaneIt! (WIP)

Code used in the derivation of TCT coefficents for PlanetScope 4-/8-band imagery; additional modules for comparison of dimension reduction methods of spectral Planetscope imagery in disease ecology/ food insecurity use cases.

## Dependencies

- My **Google Earth Engine** (GEE) multitool for image retrieval and index calculation.  
- **plaknit** – a Python package (by Dryver Finch @ UTK) for handling PlanetScope data gaps.  
  (Install with `pip install plaknit`.)

> ⚡️ *Tip:* If you want to run the scripts locally, make sure you have a GEE account configured (`earthengine authenticate`) and the `plaknit` package available in your environment.

## Getting Started
